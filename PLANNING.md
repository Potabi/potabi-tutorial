# PLANNING POTABI-TUTORIAL
The planning process before we start the actual project itself

This will start being developed AFTER the release of 1.0

## What are we making
Graphical/cli based applications to tutorialize how to do certain tasks in Potabi.

This application should guide users on how to do things from the basics of using Potabi to advanced usage topics like
creating packages, creating custom editions, modifying the software, etc.

### What pages should be included:
- Using the system
- Using the terminal
- Creating packages
- Using/Creating Ports
  - Potabi Ports
  - FreeBSD Ports
  - Custom Ports
- Building the CoreNGS src
- Building a Potabi ISO

## What we are NOT making
A Software Development Kit or Application Programming Interface.

Each SDK and API should be developed and documented seperately. This isn't the "application to know everything"
but rather the application to know the basics of developing for Potabi.
