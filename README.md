# potabi-tutorial
Help new users understand the operating system

## Goals and Intention
- Teach people the fundementals of Potabi
- Shortcuts and poweruser fundementals
- Creating packages
- Making Potabi outlast its developers
- Resources for advanced usage and development in Potabi
- Expanding contributorship

## Why
Something I was thinking about recently was that developers do not do enough to teach its users how to really
UTILIZE the tools they make. Raise your hand if you know how to make a Potabi ISO. This isn't just something
that can be taught with a couple books, good documentation, etc. We should have a dedicated graphical application
as part of the welcome and setup process to show how Potabi is built, why it is, and how people can contribute.
This tool will allow us to better utilize our community for the development of Potabi, grow our application base,
and make Potabi a much more cohesive operating system for desktop and mobile alike.
